//! The command-line front end of the bus. All of its behaviour lives in this
//! library rather than in the binary so that argument handling, exit codes and
//! output can be exercised by tests without spawning a process; the binary is a
//! single call into [`run`].
//!
//! Two properties of this crate are contracts rather than conveniences. Stdout
//! belongs to machine-readable output only, so diagnostics always go to stderr.
//! And `--version` prints exactly `agentbus <semver>` and nothing else: a host
//! that has copied this binary onto another machine compares that line
//! byte-for-byte to decide whether the copy is the build it expects, so any
//! decoration added here would break provisioning somewhere else.
